I like monkeys. |
The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece. I thought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I bought 200. |
I like monkeys. |
I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals. I laughed. Then they punched my genitals. I stopped laughing. |
I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall. |
Although humourous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour. |
Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sorta' dropped dead. Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. Damn cheap monkeys. |
I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs. |
I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys. |
I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for a while, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad. |
I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber. I was embarrassed. |
I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change them every 30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all go bad. | food
I tried burning them. Little did I know my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire. |
Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed. The odour wasn't improving. |
I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use the bathroom. I severely beat one of my monkeys. I felt better. |
I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said that the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him that I had a wet one. He couldn't take that one either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones. |
I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't know quite what to say. They pretended that they like them, but I could tell they were lying. |
Ingrates. |
So I punched them in the genitals. |
I like monkeys. |

Trying to decipher the spec for the [message for xpolog, which is over 14 years old and contains many gems |
    6. Security Considerations |
     |
       An odor may be considered to be a message that does not require any |
       acknowledgement.  People tend to avoid bad odors but are drawn to |
       odors that they associate with good food.  The acknowledgement of the |
       receipt of the odor or scent is not required and indeed it may be the |
       height of discretion to totally ignore some odors.  |

I just spoke with Janelle - there may not be enough food for everyone, so she asked that anyone who is not participating in the demo to wait for leftovers.  Same thing will apply for the BRP meals. | food

So 4.9.14 (2 weeks from today) is Rally's B-Day (the 4th Anniversary of becoming a B Corp).  The CSR team is putting on a shindig for it and you guys are going to have your own party with food and prizes (I already purchased the prizes from other Washington B Corps). Anywho, the presentation will be 12 noon PST, aka lunch time.  I totally understand what it's like to have to tune into meetings at lunchtime (All Hands are ALWAYS noon EST). While the other offices are doing a snack, I'm wondering if you all would prefer pizza to a snack that day. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this |
what's the name of the food delivery place you guys have that delivers from local restaurants? I forgot.  You are getting food delivered for the Seaspin meeting tomorrow.  Food (from Jimmy Johns) is being delivered at 5pm.

If you have a restaurant that you like, that serves a wide variety of food (food for the health conscious, vegetarians, those just looking for some good grub, etc), CATERS (family style dishes) and DELIVERS, please either 1) add the menu to the Kirkland Restaurant Menu folder in the drive 2) send me the name.  Rally Workplace Services is committed to finding foods that you all enjoy AND within our budget.

Catering Here's a deli from Carillon Point that I'm familiar with that delivers.  I believe that our budget is $8.50 pp but they (Poppin Jay's) can help us be creative by mixing 1/2 sandwiches with a salad, hot dish, etc. They make all of their own food, fresh and can provide gluten free bread. I'll take a look at PCC and Metro as well. Does anyone else have other ideas?  | ordering

Hey I'm about to order food for Thursday.  I know some of you are bringing little ones so I'm Pizza & Salad (from Zeeks) OR sandwich wraps (Goldbergs doesn't give option for lettuce wraps but there would be wraps for vegetarians)? Catering trays run a little too pricey for this event so we need to keep it simple. Therefore, please don't throw another option out unless 1. you know they deliver 2. they have reasonably priced food 3. The food is kid friendly and simple.  If you have strong opinions here let me know.  I need to order in the next hour  | ordering

Looks good Presumably you can‚Äôt search closed projects without searching across the workspace which is why that option is disabled? I can look through our icons to see if I can find a better one. My only concern would be that searching closed projects would (presumably) be a pretty rare use case, so it might be nice to make the option less prominent in the UI (but I‚Äôm not sure how to do that‚Ä¶just food for thought). Also, when a project is closed, are it‚Äôs items ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù or do they remain active? |

hey guys I did some playing around over the weekend, I found out why our docker containers take so long to build and why no image builds reuse the same cache.  if we fix the problem we should be able to cut our image build times substantially.  basically we are running the docker daemon in our docker builder containers (using docker-in-docker) which is not recommended because it prevents docker from using the cache for image builds (cache is destroyed when container goes away).  the recommended solution is to use the docker daemon running on the host machine from the containers.  this is achieved by removing DIND and mapping a  I think its a relatively easy fix, but it requires modification of the jenkins-docker-slave-plugin we use to allow mapping volumes when a container starts.

He is staying another night at GS tonight. Keep him in your thoughts please.  I'll provide more info/updates as I get them. He is doing ok at the moment. Thanks all |

Just a little FYI around this defect. was part of the call when we decided to close this defect.

The wording "crappy workaround" was a poor choice of words, I'll agree, but buffered rendering is not going to be improved upon. That's a decision that was made pretty high up the product food chain. We are more than happy to help provide more of an explanation of why something was closed like that so if you are prepping for one of those calls and would like to anticipate some of their questions and ask us for some advice on how to shape answers, please feel free to ask.  |
donuts on the food table in Boulder.... | food
you‚Äôre always showing off about what you have in your fancy fridge‚Ä¶good beer, good food, and now 1/2 & 1/2! |
#goodafternoon team. Will be WFH today. Going to hospital with food for a colleague in lunch break. Hospital is close to my house but it may take bit more than an hour.  |
i don't see these on the food table-  they must have been eaten by a bear... ??   |
Me recovering. Hope by Sunday I can start eating normal food |
- FYI, I will be taking my daughter to the doctor for a food challenge tomorrow at 8.30. If everything goes well, I should be back online around 1-2 PM MST.  |
Hey I got food poisoning last night. Spent most of the night doing things other than sleeping. I'm going to stay home today and I will try to join meetings when I feel up to it.  |
Food for "One of the comments made by several executives in the SandHill study is that they find it challenging to scale their customer success processes or program while still keep the customer-facing communications unique to each customer. What is your advice on how to scale the program?  |
Lincoln There are many ways to talk about scaling a customer success organization, but here are three things that need to customer segmentation, automation and documentation |
also, for what it is worth, the groups at IHS really like to know the "why" behind things.  I think the "why" is always important of course, but especially for IHS given how analytical they tend to me (or at least the groups I worked with).  Anyhow, just food for thought. |
It was awesome! I returned from a great ski trip with the family and celebrated at home with some brazilian food and caipirinhas! |
- here is an example regarding food supply |
is anyone from  boulder in the office yet?  Trying to get someone to let food into the kitchen and no one is at the front desk. |
are you in?  if so, can you see if the food was brought in to the front door and taken to the kitchen?  I ordered for the wrong week and am not there to receive the order | ordering
Thanks Food was delicious! |
I can't even get the ws chooser to load to get to the right ws.  I've given up and am now watching food network on free tv. |
have fun!  I agree about Shine!  It's really great (and I am not gluten free but thought the food was amazing).   |
My favorite restaurant near Pearl St mall is Salt.  Not too fancy, just good locals ingredients (you have to eat a good steak while in CO!) | mapping
I don't know if there is still snow on the ground in Boulder but if not, a hike in the Chautauqua area is always fun!  I love Rocky Mountain National Park too, but it's definitely still winter conditions there and I've never been there in winter so I wouldn't know what to expect.  Boulder Creek path, just west (I think) of downtown along Boulder Canyon road is awesome too! |
as long as the food doesn't change |
the food is staying the same afaik |
Same food |
food would be good too‚Ä¶I forgot I have to feed myself | food
ok, i need to get some food and stop starting at a computer |
Well, its that or hating myself after eating fair food so‚Ä¶. |
too much mexican food  | food
Food this week - |
That doesn't seem unrelated -- Laura used the word "Sombrero" and you suggested Mexican food |
If we have Mexican food everyday, I don't think that's a problem  | food
- extending break outs until Food is here.  |
OK thank you Please keep them coming.  Again, I appreciate your and team's help with non-glamorous task.  My plate is full these days - so timely help from you & team makes less food fall off it. |
My point is this has risen fairly high in the executive food chain.  Support saw a 40% drop in opened case volume after the switchover.  Customers can‚Äôt figure out how to open support cases any more. |

Defect Management training?  Really?  Sounds like taking a course on Junk Food Management if you are trying to get into shape instead of learning about good nutrition, diet and exercise.  Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have coaching on how to reduce technical debt?  #trainingisnotalwaystheanswer |
Love this quote from Aetna CEO Mark "No, in the past, businesses said that financial capital is the scarce resource and that people are plentiful. If you look at the jobs people used to do, an employer could always train a new employee to do the work. But it‚Äôs not just retraining somebody for a job anymore. It‚Äôs about the knowledge worker, and for Aetna, someone who has a level of empathy attention present. In that case, people are not a commodity, and now, we have a lot of financial capital in the system. So, we‚Äôve flipped the paradigm and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs invest in husband or scarce resource, which is talent ‚Äî a motivated, engaged, present worker. And let‚Äôs put at risk some of our capital to do it.‚Äù Because, if people can‚Äôt make ends meet at home with food, benefits, health, and health care in particular, how can they be present, engaged, knowledge workers when they come to work?" |
guys I'd be interested to get some opinions on this - made me laugh but then gave me food for thought. This guy is in the US and I wondered if in your markets you see a lot of this 'Agile and Scrum are the anti-christ' cropping up - feels like it's been brewing for a while. I've given it to my team and asked for us to use it as an internal team discussion/thought provoker piece to help them handle objections. Anyway - have a read, have a laugh and please do share your very valid and non evil agile consultancy opinions  |
That's because men don't listen, read or pay attention. We would rather live in caves, hunt for food and discuss sports ;-) |
thank you for the information...I found out from Skip I can go but I would have to pay for airfare, hotel, ground transportation and food because Rally will cover $2,500 towards expenses including cost of class. So, not sure I will go. |
Indeed. They get to nap a lot. I have decided cats are like teenagers. They generally ignore you except when they want your attention and when they want it, they want it NOW. Dogs are like toddlers. They follow you around wondering what you are doing and hoping that any minute you drop something interesting on the ground. Food being the best thing. Easily entertained. |
fwiw I have copy of those policies from when I worked on that account. Not sure if it‚Äôs the same (these were nothing onerous).  There were some $ limits on food, no we won‚Äôt buy you a bottle of tequila every night and split your expenses please... |
On the club access besides having a place to wait in comfort they have wifi, food and most importantly if you are stuck due to delays there is a human to help you |
United is really my only option living near DC.  They have a great rewards program.  I've managed to take family on a lot of trips with it - makes up in a small way for all the time I am away.  Good entertainment on long-haul flights.  Good food you can buy, bad food you get free.  Domestic first is barely better than economy plus unless you like to drink on a plane (I don't, yes I know hard to believe).  In-flight, gate and check-in service level is amongst the worst.  I don't care for United's lounges but British Airways are great.  JetBlue is great, Southwest has great service, Norwegian too. |
I‚Äôve had both food poisoning and stomach flu on flights‚Ä¶worst thing ever.  You dont want anything to happen because you might not stop plus the nice breath you have afterwards.  I kept thinking, ‚ÄúI can make it to my hotel, then collapse‚Äù. | food
Ugh... that is why I have made it a rule to never eat Mexican or really spicy food before a flight... | food
Santa Clara is my office too. i keep hoping they'll deliver some of this Caribbean food they're emailing us about  |
IMHO, you need to have finished delivering the Release Planning simulation by the end of Day 1.  I find that Day 2 jumps between team, program and portfolio level and as a learner I would find that frustrating.  Also, the Portfolio section tends to fall in the after lunch "food coma" lull.  However (!), when we delivered v3.03 this week, the books we got from the printers were in a different order to usual (we're not sure why yet), and IMHO it worked better (though Day 1 is a bit of an "acronym attack" for newbies - they may break out in hives).  The re-arranged order (Day 1) Embracing lean & agile values, understanding safe, Agile portfolio, (Day 2) Agile Release Train, Release Planning, Releasing value, Lean-agile enterprise.  This order meant there was less jumping between the 3 SAFe levels. |
I did LSAFe last week with Eric and am doing it this coming week at TWC.  I'll put some thought into some additional feedback as I go through it with TWC but for now, I agree with some of the comments around redundancy.  I understand that repetitive content can help solidify the knowledge, but I think there is too much repetition with some concepts in the course.  I also really do not like the simulation and would much rather see something more like the Lego game or even the new food game that leaves people with an analogy of the approach and what happens as opposed to them getting so stuck in the weeds of database upgrades and shipping methods that they fail to get the underlying point.  I think more activities and role playing would also help people understand the concepts.   |
I wish they would've kept the architectural section as opposed to it being a part of others, in my experience, teams/groups do not give non-functionals and architectural epics enough attention and by the time they realize it, they have technical debt up to their ears.   |
After next weeks session I'll provide some additional feedback as this will be fresh on my mind to look for opportunities.   |
I know did a lot of work there, and if you're visiting Indy then let me know and I'll give you some fun food suggestions (I worked 2 blocks from their office for 2 years, and in the city for 8 years) |
I only have time (tomorrow/dinner) for one -- which would you go with (I like ALL food) | food
I don't think there is, but If anyone is still in the Boulderado tonight and I are meeting at 6.30 in the corner bar and heading out for food. |

"Failure is a poison, and when James reentered the Cavs‚Äô headquarters last fall, he found an organization infected. Players rolled in late for treatment sessions, bagged extra shooting, left plates of food sitting around the cafeteria. There was no individual to blame. The coaching staff was new. The front office was revamped. James doesn‚Äôt like to reference power‚Äî'People confuse that word way too often,' he says‚Äîchoosing opportunity instead.

We have several things updating the [SAFe toolkit the [SAI partner social promotion, blogs, webinar with Dean, RO Jan all hands,.... We could use a Services review of this [4.0 master  Is anyone needing a break from holiday |
Even if we dont agree with what people are saying - lets face it a bunch of people didnt and dont agree with Dean either, it provides food for thought. |
Hi I definitely understand your need and appreciate the feedback.  It would be food for you to also provide that feedback to Steve Breese.  He might reconsider the existing Kanban states or create a new custom field for your needs. |
I got to wondering about ways to handle the "big room planning travel is too expensive" objection, and started running some numbers... Do these look plausible?  |
Sizing 150 (full ART + stakeholders etc), 50% traveling from remote sites |
Cost  $1k per day per person (air, hotel, food) |
??? Does anyone know what it costs to contract with a hotel for a ballroom and services for two days?)  |
This looks to me to be an investment for one ART of $150k for travel for the two days, not including the event space and any services.  |
Do these assumptions look like they would hold water in real world discussions? |
I get that perception, as there are a lot of logistics that RTEs tend to get involved in (venue, food, invites, setup, ‚Äútheme") that would resemble a ‚Äúparty‚Äù.  Not that they have to do all (or any) of that work, but are responsible to organizing activities especially PI. |
The RTE in Real Estate solved it by getting an event planner. Valid solution? So now she is only facilitating but not responsible for venue and food.  |

Heard something I liked around Innovation this week on a webinar.  Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù, instead say ‚Äúlearn fast‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt want to fail, but do want to learn quickly.  Kind of like using ‚Äúdrink your own champagne‚Äù rather than ‚Äúeat your own dog food‚Äù sentiments. |
One more  I don't sell Agile anymore, I don't sell practices anymore, I do sell continuous improvement, I do sell outcome-driven, I do sell incremental approach.  Food for thought when you talk with Execs... |
OK, this is a little funny and a little long for the services flow, but because several of you have asked me yesterday/today‚Ä¶ it almost feels like there is a (miniature!) elephant in the room. I‚Äôm TOTALLY still with CA and staying with this AMAZING crew. I have indeed accepted an advisor position with [The Food Corridor](thefoodcorridor.com) ‚Äî who are doing good by doing well, connecting our local food systems! (local food producers with local kitchens). But I‚Äôve always spent my time with local startups! I co-lead Fort Collins Startup Week, I volunteer with Startup Colorado, I've run pitch and lean startup meetups... and have always advised local startups! This team just has such great consideration for social responsibility, such great team EQ and amazing discipline around lean startup techniques, combined with amazing domain expertise‚Ä¶ that we chose to make it more formal (and announce on linked in). **Short I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I learn so much from you all, and I LOVE working with you all. And I‚Äôm proud to try and help us drink our own champagne at CA... and serve and connect this AMAZING TRIBE! (Help me do that more and better?)! Looking forward to speaking with more of you during our empathy interviews and seeing ALL OF YOU at the agility services conference (pka coaches conference). |
Cool.  Actually curious if we could ask the food provider to label anything as nut-free/not cross-contaminated.  (Have one person in the class with an allergy. She's cool about it; just went out to get her own food because not sure about the cross-contamination thing.)  Just thought I'd ask; not a big deal. |
I've go some food poisoning or other type of bug. I'm wreckage. |
food for thought...people don't buy what you do you but why you do it. Simon Sinek TED talk on "Start with (short version) |
I listened to this years ago but still found the refresher valuable... |
Here is the room they have for us.. They will arrange it in pods for us. Can provide as many flipcharts as we need, etc.. $300 food/beverage minimum per day and the rental is free. projector, reception, etc will be additional. |
Ack!!! Start without me. Putting up food. Be there in 2 |
Let me count the ways I love  truly good food options, fast wifi, wifi reaches the plane when it's at the gate, a yoga room |
Ha! There are Rachel Weston‚Äôs far more famous than me. A NJ food writer whose twitter handle is roxydynamite (!!!), an NZ singer (that‚Äôs her pic), and former Vermont state rep.  |
Really just asking to see if I needed to bring food to the meeting |
you should always bring food to a meeting |
Food acquired by nefarious means always tastes better, don't 'cha think? |
Ok, you should have a JJ email in your inbox. Follow the link and order food. You can go "unwhich" for lettuce wrap version if you don't want bread-y products. |
if JJ's food can't support anyone's dietary prefs please let me know. I don't want to fail on food  |
ah ha‚Ä¶that explains it‚Ä¶although I think it came out more like a $401,224,199 feature due to added food bills |
Rats! No food for me; we have Leonid‚Äôs empathy interview coming up! |
Some wonderful food for thought as we do our hard/great |
I'll be on in 10 minutes, I need to run down and get some food since I just realized I have 3 hours of meeting without a break |
I haven't really left the room other than to find good food and music ;) |
Good, short article from the best companies hire for attitude and train for skill. |

Ohhhh! isn't it annoying when there is this "Well, there is nothing we can do." Hence my acupuncture today (which wiped me out...weird) and trying a new set of vitamins, minerals, green food powders, and yes, Chinese mushrooms. Please please take care of you first. You just came off of a sinus thingus, non? BTW, while buying out Pharmaca, I ran into Melissa Pickering who leaves next week for Uganda for a design thinking workshop and then non-profit work. Wow.

no, but if your food expenses are less than 70$ a day, you don‚Äôt need a receipt |
but i submitted no food receipts from last trip |
you need to classify your expenses in the buffer as food |

Consider this in your messaging‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs actually safer to have your data in the cloud with someone you trust, lest you end up like MedStar. Some low level person opened a phishing email and let the hackers right through the higher and thicker firewall. But these were ransomware hackers, who promptly encrypted ALL of MedStar‚Äôs data, including patient records, and are demanding a payment to unencrypted it. MedStar has been reduced to filling out paper forms to service patient. Paper!!! Had their data been distributed around the cloud, the hackers could have never done this. |
I know DoD & Intel will never buy that argument, but the Civilian agencies might is you can make the right risk analysis for the sensitivity level of the data. If an agency CISO is completely confident they‚Äôd pass an IG audit, then great sell them OnPrem. Otherwise, the data is safer in the Cloud. Food for thought‚Ä¶. |

Amazing food, lots of wine, beer and cider - and of course there will be lots inspiring stories and a tonne of fun. | food
It's on Saturday June 13 7PM in South Yarra - tickets are very limited so please grab them ASAP if you're coming to avoid missing out. You can grab your tix from www.onegirl.org.au/gala |
See you there Chantelle |
It was cold- I wore the uggies in and home‚Ä¶ Oh look you can‚Äôt see the food I dropped down my front in this pic- winning! |
Lunch, CA style #Canberra.  So much food they are almost forcing it on and me. |
- Here is food for thought - When we call from CA phones it comes up as a private number..  I don‚Äôt answer private numbers, and nor do most people I know.  This could be somethings small and simple we could fix that may mean more people will answer our calls? |
We even impressed an Architect at Bendigo & Adelaide Bank this week! "Thanks for organising yesterday‚Äôs session which I found very informative and refreshingly natural. I have been to a few vendor session and they were more of a sales pitch than a subject matter expertise session.  Both, David and Suzanne, were a mine of information and I was glad that they had so many real-life case-studies/examples to share with us. The topic was definitely food for thought for the Customer and Partner team."  |
Great food for thought. |
Food for thought why does this dashboard suggest we have 49 defects in a not looked at state.  Not 24  |
There has been some grumbling that Rally has become a less fun place to work recently, and Mike Holm on the Gnarwhal team took the initiative to do something about that and plan an engineering celebration in Boulder. We are spending a few hundred bucks and bringing in a company that will put together a lazer tag setup, and letting people run around on the third floor of the new building to zap each other. I'm sure we will cater in some food too. |
I'll eat their food if they don't make it. |
Food in Raleigh has arrived, so once i grab that, i'll show up |
I am back - eating some food real quick and then will SH |

Good Morning Paas , we (the scrum masters) are trying to square away Hackathon and BRP food order numbers this week.  We've got 5 types of diets that we are asking folks to slot themselves into... | food
1. No Gluten | food
2. Vegetarians | food
3. Vegans | food
4. Specialized Diets (don't fit into any of these previous 3 groups) | food
5. Consumers of most All Foods |
Please confirm with me which one best fits you. Let me know if there are any of the Hack or BRP events you won't be at. For food order purposes, I'm going to err on the side of assuming everyone will be at all the things | food
ALSO... If you have suggestions on where we should order from, let me know (no promises) |
Thanks!! |
#hack #food |
I'm a 5, but not positive that I'll be present, depends on when hack week is  |
You could peruse [PR for me while I run for food |
and you‚Äôll get all the free food i‚Äôll be buying. |
We have to go boxes ready but no food in them yet... | food
trying to get food figured out for BRP week.  can you guys let me know if anyone is a vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free?  thank you! | food
I am on a sea food diet | food
if I see food, I eat it. |
i'm shoving food down my throat right now |
you gonna share your food too? |
jarvis image me master bacon food truck |
how late are you here today? we're finishing retro then I need to eat some food, but after that we can SH and get it running |
I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶ just let me grab my food and get back to my desk. |
shoveling food, will be back in a few minutes |
No food at big boss right? |
I'll check Oak and Dagger. Big Boss does not have food and charges a $500 fee for space. If not I'll check back with Crank Arm. Thanks for the input guys! | food
if you need a place try the Lynnwood Brewing Concern. It's off Atlantic and Whitiker Mill. They open at 3pm on Friday, have 13 beers on tap and a cool outdoor space. A food truck usually shows up around 5 but they can come early. Or you can bring food or order pizzas. My neighbors and I go there Friday nights and it's packed.  |
- I talked to Ted at Lynnwood and this seems like a lot of fun. They may be able to get a food truck to come in at 3pm or we can do catering from lynnwood grill. I say we go this route for our post BRP celebration unless I hear any objections!  |
- if you want in on snacks, lunch, and post big room planning please make sure you are on this sheet and you are counted. The entire office (not just CA AC) is welcome to the food and celebration. If you are on IO and HHA I pre populated the spreadsheet from asking at stand up. Can you also add a comment next to your name if you are vegetarian or require any other special requests? 1 = you will be there 0 = you will not. Thanks!  |
are y‚Äôall interested in free food? |
free food sounds great, but unfortunately I‚Äôll still be in PA for the dates in that spreadsheet |
Welcome, set it all up! Please take a To Go (I just put them next to the food)  container and pack whatever you want. I am going to put everything else in the fridge at I'll ask that the cleaning crew not throw this stuff away. |
- food is here if you have not already got it |
Angela and Candice will be in town next week.  They would like to talk with everyone in the office.  We‚Äôre working to move meetings and rearrange schedules.  Please let me know if you did NOT get invites for next Wed.  The outlook list may not be up to date.  The plan also includes grilling for lunch, so free food! |
Thank you to grillers - and also to for picking up food | food
There are some popsickles in freezer as A) a gluten-free alternative to cookies or B) anyone who feels they've earned a 2nd dessert. | food
Dearest  The freezer door was SLIGHTLY left open last night, so the ice kept melting and refreezing.  So i tossed a big block away.  For anyone that may have food in there, I would advise a check to ensure it's still good. | food
Thanks for the link. I looked for it before and didn't find it. I'm sure it's coffier than my current breakfast. I am not a coffee drinker. I'm looking forward to the solid bars, if they are good for travel. One size does not fit all. They need more more flavors, more special formulations for age and lifestyle... basically like the cat and dog food industries, but for human nutrition and tastes. | food
amongst the grilling food, there‚Äôs a bag of homegrown cucumbers free for the taking.  I‚Äôll put them on the counter this afternoon and send another note to the flow.  <swirl type=‚Äúhypnotic‚Äù>You want to take a few cucumbers home.  They‚Äôre yummy.</swirl> | food
freezer door was left open last night. Please check your food before eating it. | food
Please refrain from putting messages regarding food in the flow after i've already left the office in the future.  Thank you. |
I‚Äôm sure the food is still in the fridge.  Plus, I have more at home. | food
Also, I have a Kelly Kettle (Base Camp model) if anyone needs to be able to boil water or cook food  | food
It went well. Lots of guests... Lots of members... Lots of food... Lots of good conversation... Got home late... Nobody from the Raleigh office showed up, but keep in mind that Toastmasters welcomes guests anytime; you just don't necessarily get the high-level view of what Toastmasters is about, and you don't get fed. We meet every Tuesday night. | food

wow, such lunch, much food.  thanks for all the great dishes | food
Yes this happens with some regularity. They are supposed to investigate at a higher tier in the security food chain. I haven't gotten any info on what is causing it. If it's an automatic process that is causing it to fail on my end. I need to know that that is what's happening.  And not some other thing. |
it‚Äôs not sea-*food*, Val, it‚Äôs sea-*juice* |
I left a few menus in the break room for Red Pepper Asian, imo the best Chinese food in Raleigh. Check 'em out if you haven't yet! | ordering
tough call. I can speak to ale house as having great food and a wide selection of food and beers. Carbon I have never been to or tried so I would totally be down for that, though looks like the menu is much more limited.. | ordering

had a good buddy of mine stick around for one of the storm only to have his neighbor call them (who evacuated) and tell them that since the power was out to go into their garage and eat the food in their deep freezer... .turns out they were big into lobster fishing.... so grilled lobster for the week while they waited for power to come back | food
I don't have any cool stories like that of the storms in Maine We sat inside, with candles, and ate canned food, and the side deck fell off the house once? lol | food

sooooo...what's the late lunch policy? I missed mine, b/c meetings and then helping with phone coverage. should i go now or can I just leave for the day a bit early? I dont' want to mess up coverage this afternoon, but I'm just looking at the clock and feeling like I'd rather just finish up my work over the next than grab food and come back. no bigs if that causes issues though. didn't know what you guys usually did in such situations.  |
Reposting email September 23rd we are hosting the second annual Agile Central Developers‚Äô Conference. The conference is a forum where we can meet as a software community and learn from each other.

Hey / ‚Äì  |
There's been a few folks taking food meant for AgileU classes from the back kitchen. Now we've had TWO instances of the class being short on lunch because CA/Rally staff took sandwiches/wraps before the class. That's unfathomably rude and embarrassing.  | food
Please don't eat our paying guest's food until gives the thumbs up via this Flow or email. | food
that‚Äôs pretty bad. the back kitchen food should be off-limits, and only food in the main kitchen is available to scavenge. it always worries me when someone says ‚Äúfood in back kitchen‚Äù or if they come walking off the bridge with food | food
Maybe we should hire a hobo to guard the AgileU food. |
‚Äúhere, watch this food and make sure no one eats it" | food
Good Morning Today is Fridge clean out day! Please trash/take any food you have! Also, there's lots of OJ in the back Auditorium fridge if anyone would like that. Happy Friday and have a GREAT weekend! | food
So I am curious how the food I left in the fridge on tuesday got tossed if Friday was clean out day?   | food
Hi Sorry that happened! I've decided to go the route of simply reminding the office to clean out their food instead of me or any other individual doing it. So not sure who is trashing your food/containers.  | food
so wait some random person is going into the fridge and tossing all the food in there at random then?  Thats pretty of someone to do!  How can we stop that from occurring? |
Disregard! Food for bike to work folks will be here shortly from Mod Market!  | ordering
my roommates and I are having a belated house warming party this Saturday and you are all welcome to come by. Going to start with a backyard bbq in the afternoon. There will be music, beer, good food, games and will be family friendly. As the sun goes down the partying goes up and we will probably get less family friendly lol. Feel free to come by and leave whenever works for you. If you are interested in participating in any of the festivities, reach out to me and I will give you the rest of the details. Cheers! |
